# Calculator-Advanced-Swift-iOS13-Completed-Updated-
The same calculator app from AppBrewery but with bugs fixed 

- display label now shows Int characters properly instead of doubles with trailing zeros (i.e 1 instead of 1.0)
- adjusted the AC button to do the same and displaying “0” int instead of “0.0” when clearing screen
- adjusted the decimal/period button to start with 0. instead of displaying “.” as the first character when no number was entered
- prevented the addition of multiple decimals in a number which leads to crashing the app
